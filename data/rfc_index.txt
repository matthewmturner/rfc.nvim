Obsoletes xxxx refers to other RFCs that this one replaces;
Obsoleted by xxxx refers to RFCs that have replaced this one.
Updates xxxx refers to other RFCs that this one merely updates (but
does not replace); Updated by xxxx refers to RFCs that have updated
(but not replaced) this one.  Generally, only immediately succeeding
and/or preceding RFCs are indicated, not the entire history of each
related earlier or later RFC in a related series.

The (Also FYI ##) or (Also STD ##) or (Also BCP ##) phrase gives the
equivalent FYI, STD, or BCP number if the RFC is also in those
document sub-series.  The Status field gives the document's
current status (see RFC 2026).  The (DOI ddd) field gives the
Digital Object Identifier.
